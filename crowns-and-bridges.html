                        <h4>Restore Your Smile with Custom Crowns and Bridges</h4>
                        <p>
                            Is there a gap in your smile? One or more damaged or missing teeth can make it harder to
                            feel confident in your smile or laughter and may interfere with speaking or chewing. Missing
                            back teeth affect your chewing efficiency which leads to a multitude of other problems.
                            Untreated, a missing tooth could cause those around it to change positions and disturbs the
                            equilibrium between the other teeth. When you book your appointment, Amelia Street Dental
                            Clinic can help you determine whether crowns and/or bridges can help restore the fullness of
                            your smile or help restore and balance the chewing efficiency.

                                    The function of a crown is to cover or “cap” a damaged tooth or protect a tooth from
                                    future damage. It strengthens the tooth <span id="serv-dot-02">...</span>

                                        A crown is also inserted on top of a dental implant to restore a missing tooth
                                        and make it functional. Usually, crowns are advised if more than 60% of the
                                        existing tooth is filled or broken down or decayed.

                                    Porcelain or Ceramic is the most preferred material for fabrication of crowns. It is
                                    the most aesthetic and a exact shade match <span id="serv-dot-03">...</span>

                                        can be achieved. It gives a natural appearance. Metal free ceramics like
                                        Zirconia or Emax are the new norm. Crowns can also be done by using metal alloys
                                        of gold or Cobalt Chromium or Acrylic resins. Each have their own indications.
                                        Sometimes a combination of porcelain fused to metal (PFM) is used to fabricate a
                                        crown as it is considered stronger than a metal free ceramic crown.
