                                    Wisdom tooth removal is a surgical procedure to extract impacted wisdom teeth. <span

                                        Your wisdom teeth may come in as early as your late teen years. In some cases,
                                        they may not grow in until you are in your early 20s.<br><br>
                                        Our mouths do not have room for our wisdom teeth in many cases. As a result,
                                        they may grow in at unusual angles, and may crowd up against other teeth.

                                    While wisdom tooth removal is a form of oral surgery, it is a fast, outpatient
                                    procedure if it is done in the dental chair. Here is what to expect: <span
                                        id="serv-dot-04">...</span><br><br>
                                    <span id="serv-more-04" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        1. We start with dental X-rays and a full consult. The dentist will decide on
                                        the difficulty level if you will need to be referred toa specialist oral
                                        surgeon. It is not necessary to be sedated during wisdom tooth extraction, but
                                        the option exists.<br>
                                        2. Come in for your wisdom tooth removal appointment. We will administer local
                                        anaesthesia of for the procedure.<br>
                                        3. The dental surgeon will make the necessary incisions to expose the impacted
                                        teeth. Some bone drilling is done to facilitate the removal of the impacted
                                        tooth.<br>
                                        4. Next, the surgical site is fully debrided and all small bone fragments are
                                        cleaned off.<br>
                                        5. Sutures are then placed to close the extraction site.<br>
                                        6. We will cover the wounds with gauze. Your blood will then clot.<br>
                                        7. You can then head home with a set of after-care instructions. You can drive
                                        home alone but if you have been sedated for the procedure, you may need someone
                                        to give you a ride.<br>
                                        The whole process only takes around 60 -90 minutes!<br><br>
                                        Generally, wisdom teeth on one side (top and bottom) are removed in one
                                        appointment but all 4 wisdom teeth can be done in one appointment if the patient
                                        so desires.

                                    After your wisdom teeth are out, you should recover fast. The following aftercare
                                    tips will help your gums to heal quickly and properly: <span

                                        • Keep the post extraction gauze tightly held between your teeth at least for 1
                                        hour. This allows for a good clot to form.<br>
                                        • Do not spit when expelling blood. If you do, you might remove the clots that
                                        are forming and the bleeding may continue.<br>
                                        • Apply ice on the operated side from outside for control of your swelling. Some
                                        selling is expected and normal.<br>
                                        • Use the pain medication we prescribe, or over-the-counter pain meds.<br>
                                        • Stay away from hot foods and drinks a well as beverages that contain caffeine
                                        or carbonation. Smoking is big risk for formation of a dry socket so should be
                                        avoided for 4 days minimum.<br>
                                        • Only soft foods are suitable for 24 hours after surgery.<br>
                                        • Wait 24 hours before brushing or using mouthwash.<br>
                                        • Rest as needed.<br>
                                        • Contact your dentist if bleeding does not cease, swelling gets worse, or you
                                        have signs of an infection.
