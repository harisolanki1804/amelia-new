                        <h4>We Give You a Brand New Smile</h4>
                        <p>
                            Nearly all of us will experience dental issues like dental cavities, chipped teeth, bleeding
                            gums or yellowish teeth at some point in our lives. These are simple issues and have
                            straightforward solutions. However quite a few of us have more complicated dental concerns
                            like multiple lost teeth, extensive wear of the teeth, misalignment of teeth, pain in the
                            jaw joints etc. These complex problems leads to a variety of problems like inability to chew
                            well, extreme sensitivity or continuous recurrent pain and can wreck havoc in function and
                            appearance which ultimately leads to a loss of confidence and self-esteem.<br><br>
                            Dentistry has advanced in leaps and bounds in the past decade and it is possible to give
                            beautiful long-lasting solutions to patients who have multiple dental needs. This treatment
                            modality is called as “Full Mouth Rehabilitation” and our dentist’s at Amelia Street Dental
                            Clinic - Jeet and Vijaya Wagh have decades of experience in treating patients with complex
                            dental needs.<br><br>
                            Full-mouth rehabilitation (FMR – also called full-mouth reconstruction) is not a single
                            dental treatment. Rather, it is a treatment modality which encompasses a variety of
                            treatments and procedures performed over time which are aimed at getting you a new smile and
                            keeping your mouth healthy. It requires a thorough treatment planning, meticulous execution
                            at the same time keeping ones expectations realistic. It may also involve the contribution
                            of different dental specialists. But be assured, we at Amelia Street Dental Clinic can give
                            you a whole new smile with full mouth rehabilitation so that you will enjoy better oral
                            health, will feel better and will even have a great attractive smile.

                                <h4>What is Full Mouth Rehabilitation?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Full mouth rehabilitation is our comprehensive, fully personalized process for
                                    restoring a mouth that requires multiple<span id="serv-dot-01">...</span>
                                    <span id="serv-more-01" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        types of treatments.<br><br>
                                        Getting full mouth rehabilitation may involve bridges and crowns, veneers,
                                        implants, root canals, braces, dentures, gum treatment and other treatments. It
                                        also involves thorough understanding and analysis of your occlusion and jaw
                                        position, jaw movement and an attempt to simulate your teeth and jaw position
                                        when you were a young adult. It involves regaining your lost “The vertical
                                        dimension” which is relative position of the teeth and jaw with respect to each
                                        other. Loss of vertical dimension is the consequence of multiple problems like
                                        extensive wear of teeth, loss of multiple teeth, cavities, gum problems
                                        etc.<br><br>
                                        Note that we also offer a process called a “smile makeover.” A smile makeover
                                        typically is what we recommend for milder problems or fewer issues and is more
                                        related to the front teeth. A full mouth rehabilitation is our more extensive
                                        but comprehensive option for those with multiple problems and more severe dental
                                        problems in front and back teeth.<br>
                                        During your consultation, we can let you know what the ideal treatment option is
                                        for you. Either way, you will be getting a customized plan tailored to your
                                        mouth and goals.
