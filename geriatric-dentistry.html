                                <p>
                                    Geriatric dentistry is simply what we call the dental services we perform for older
                                    adults or Seniors.<span id="serv-dot-01">...</span><br><br>
                                    <span id="serv-more-01" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        Our focus is on preserving and maximizing the appearance and function of your
                                        teeth, gums, and jaws. It is even more important here in Australia for the
                                        seniors to take care of their teeth, gums and oral health as statistical studies
                                        have shown that out adult population is going to live longer till around 94-95
                                        years of age. If they are able to maintain most of the dentition then
                                        age-related problems of chewing well, digestion, appearance and smile will be
                                        well taken care of.<br><br>
                                        We also consider your oral health in the context of your overall health. The
                                        mouth can offer a window through which to detect other health issues for early
                                        treatment.

                                <h3>What to Expect During Your Appointment</h3>
                                <p>
                                    We believe that “minimum intervention dentistry” is generally the best course for
                                    senior patients. Our goal is to maximize your oral health and minimize invasiveness
                                    and expenditures.<br><br>
                                    When you book your appointment, we work to provide you with a time and day that will
                                    fit your scheduling needs. We even offer special care for patients in long-term aged
                                    care facilities.<br><br>
                                    XYZ Dental provides a soothing atmosphere for your appointments. Our compassionate
                                    staff are empathetic and proactive in offering education to our patients. We put an
                                    emphasis on prevention so you can spend less time in the dentist’s office and more
                                    time with your loved ones.<br><br>
                                    Our staff have a strong understanding of how specific dental problems may correlate
                                    with systematic medical conditions. We also know how medications that are common for
                                    seniors to take may impact oral health and dental treatment.<br><br>
                                    Through our comprehensive exams, we are able to individualize strategies for each of
                                    our senior patients. It is important for the seniors to consult with their general
                                    practitioner and dentist for effective management of their general and oral
                                    health.<br><br>
                                    How to Maintain Your Oral Health After Your Visit<br>
                                    Between appointments, you can maintain your oral health by:<br><br>
                                    • Flossing, brushing, and using mouthwash daily.<br>
                                    • Not smoking.<br>
                                    • Avoiding eating too much sugar.<br>
                                    • Speaking to your doctor about medications that may be causing dry mouth.<br><br>

                                    Aging may have robbed previous generations of their teeth, healthy gums, and
                                    smiles—but it does not have to do the same to you.<br><br>
                                    As you get older, you can continue to eat, talk, and laugh with a brilliant
                                    smile.<br>
