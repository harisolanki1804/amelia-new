                            grinding or clenching can be prolonged and result in stress on the Temporomandibular Joint
                            (TMJ) and the teeth. It can be stay throughout the day, destroying your quality of
                            life.<br><br>
                            Finding a doctor to treat TMJ and bruxism (teeth grinding) can be a challenge, as medical
                            doctors feel these disorders are outside their domain. But the dental experts at Amelia

                                    TMJ stands for “temporomandibular joint.” You have two of these joints, one on
                                    either side of your face, where your jaw connects <span id="serv-dot-01">...</span>

                                        to the rest of your skull. There are several muscles of mastication attached to
                                        the TMJ and the mandible which control the opening and closing of the
                                        jaw.<br><br>
                                        A variety of disorders can affect the TMJ. Technically, these are called
                                        temporomandibular disorders (TMD). But colloquially, we often just call them
                                        “TMJ.”<br><br>
                                        If you have TMD or TMJ, you may have pain in your jaw or jaw joints, either or
                                        both ears, or other parts of your face or head.<br><br>
                                        It could be hard for you to chew, and your jaw may not slide smoothly open and
                                        closed. You might also hear a noise like clicking when opening or closing your
                                        mouth.

                                <p>
                                    Related to TMJ is bruxism, which is simply the technical name for grinding or
                                    clenching teeth. It is considered a parafunctional<span id="serv-dot-03">...</span>

                                        habit and happens subconsciously and involuntarily during sleep so is also
                                        called as “Sleep Bruxism”. This forceful grinding can affect people of any age
                                        but is common in children, adolescents, or young adults. Most bruxers aren’t
                                        aware of their grinding and can apply upto of 100-120 kgs of force. This can
                                        result in damaging effects on the teeth, the supporting joint and the associated
                                        muscles. The teeth can wear down, develop microcracks or fracture as a result of
                                        bruxism. The TMJ joint and the surrounding musculature may become very sore
                                        resulting inability to open or close the mouth adequately or perform normal
                                        masticatory function. If you do it in your sleep,it can disturb its
                                        quality.<br><br>
                                        TMJ and bruxism are not the same thing. Some people with TMJ do not clench or
                                        grind, and many people with bruxism do not have TMJ.<br><br>
                                        But the overlap is quite common. If you have TMJ, there is a good chance you do
                                        have bruxism. And if you clench or grind and are starting to notice TMJ
                                        symptoms, it is best to act fast to prevent the problem from getting worse.

                                    beneficial. Remember that it is to be done on both the sides simultaneously.<br>
                                    4. Massage of the muscles of mastication (Opening and closing muscles of the mouth)
