                                    Exams and cleans are the core procedures of routine preventative oral care.<span

                                        These procedures should be routinely done for every individual and help you
                                        maintain a healthy disease-free mouth and are very rewarding. The 6 monthly
                                        periodic check-up and clean is a part of proactively managing your gum
                                        (periodontal) disease and thus preventing it from establishing. Long term gum
                                        disease results in tooth mobility, gum abscesses and ultimately tooth
                                        loss.<br><br>

                                        When you schedule an exam and clean, we will examine your teeth and gum for
                                        signs of decay or disease, remove plaque and calculus deposits, and polish your
                                        teeth. Topical Fluoride gel application is also done as a part of preventive
                                        care. Diagnostic intraoral x-rays may be taken during this appointment to
                                        diagnose interdental decay and check for interdental bone loss.

                                        it is probably time for an exam and cleaning. <br><br>

                                        We also recommend that you get a dental exam and cleaning once every six months,
                                        even if your teeth and gums look and feel great. <br><br>

                                        Doing so will ensure you do not even have to worry about a build-up of plaque
                                        and will go a long way toward preventing gum disease and other oral health

                                        missing. We will assess the condition of existing fillings. We will then assess
                                        the status of the gums, the amount of calculus deposits, and the soft tissue
                                        including the oral mucosa, the hard palate, the soft palate and the tongue. We
                                        will perform an initial cancer screen of the lateral borders of the tongue,
                                        floor of the mouth and the throat. We will then take intraoral some intraoral
                                        X-rays. These will allow us to check for decay that might be hard to see or
                                        missed by an intraoral mirror. High-definition intraoral camera are used to take

                                        orthopantomograph (OPG) is taken to check for dental pathology in the jaw bones.

                                        your gums. We will get all those hard-to-reach places that are tough to clean at
                                        home on your own each day.<br><br>
                                        Throughout your visit, or dentist or hygienist will ask you how you are doing

                                        We will then polish your teeth to give them that smooth, sparkling finish you
                                        can only get at the dentist’s office. As a final step we will apply a topical
