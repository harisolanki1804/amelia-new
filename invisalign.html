                        <p>
                            What if there were a way you could align your teeth without having to wear braces?<br><br>
                            Traditional braces work well, but there is no denying they come with some inconveniences.
                            Many people do not like the appearance of metal in their mouths. Plus, flossing and eating
                            while wearing regular braces can pose some challenges. They also can cause ulcers and mouth
                            soreness and the wire components may hurt.<br><br>
                            Clear aligners or Invisalign solves all of these problems! This modern alternative to
                            traditional braces involves wearing transparent aligners periodically to effect change in
                            the position of teeth and ultimately give you a beautiful smile.<br><br>
                            You can hardly see them, and you can take them in and out whenever you want.

                                <h4>What are Clear Aligners? Invisalign? Are there other brands?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Clear aligners are custom made aligners which are transparent. Invisalign is one of
                                    the major brands which manufactures <span id="serv-dot-01">...</span>
                                    <span id="serv-more-01" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        these aligners. There are many options and different brands available in the
                                        market today. Invisalign being the pioneer in this field is the most popular
                                        one. In Australia, the other brands which are popular are Smile Styler,
                                        Angelalign, Clear Correct, Sure Smile, etc. All these use a patented software to
                                        treatment plan and digitally simulate the teeth correction. A special
                                        resin material is used manufacture the aligners. The results achieved with any
                                        of them is excellent and comparable to Invisalign provided the case has been
                                        treatment planned well.<br><br>
                                        These clear aligners are used as a set for Upper and lower teeth and are changed
                                        every two weeks for optimal results. The number of sets of aligners needed are
                                        determined by the difficulty of the case and the amount of correction required.
                                        Each sequential aligner applies progressive forces on your teeth as a whole to
                                        facilitate the movement of teeth into a desired configuration gradually.<br><br>
                                        Unlike braces, Clear aligners are not bonded to your teeth, nor is there any
                                        metal.<br><br>
                                        Instead, you have clear aligners that fit over your teeth which are completely
                                        customized to you.<br><br>
                                        At a glance, most people will not even notice you are wearing them.

                                    in your appearance while you are using them. <span id="serv-dot-04">...</span>

                                        Say goodbye to the idea of a mouth full of metal! <br>
                                        • You can eat anything you want. You get to remove the aligners whenever you
                                        want, so you can enjoy foods that are impossible to eat with braces—yes, even
                                        corn on the cob.<br>
                                        • Brushing and flossing is so easy. Trying to floss around traditional braces is
                                        a challenge. But with Invisalign, you just take out the aligners and brush and
                                        floss the way you always do.<br>
                                        • Clear Aligners doesn’t get in your way. Whether you want to play a musical
                                        instrument or enjoy a kiss with that special someone, you can just take the
                                        aligners out for a little bit.<br>
                                        • Skip the adjustment appointments you would need for regular braces.<br>
                                        • There is no worrying about broken wires or brackets. When a wire breaks or a
                                        bracket dislodges on traditional braces, you have to come and get it fixed as
                                        soon as possible to ensure continuity of treatment.<br>
                                        • Keep your confidence high. Many people struggle with their self-esteem while
                                        wearing old-fashioned braces. Clear Aligners lets you smile with pride.

                                    1. We start with a consultation where we take a scan of your teeth or impressions to
                                    make moulds of your teeth. We also take <span id="serv-dot-05">...</span>
                                    <span id="serv-more-05" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        intraoral and extra oral photos and the OPG
                                        and the lateral cephalogram xrays. We then create the orthodontic problem list
                                        and come up with the best personalized plan for aligning your teeth.<br><br>
                                        2. Next, we send your scans and all the xrays and photographs to the aligner
                                        company for a computer simulation of your treatment plan. Our recommendations
                                        and treatment goals are enlisted to them.<br><br>
                                        3. An company expert then creates a simulation of your treatment by recommending
                                        the number of aligners and attachments. This personalised treatment plan then is
                                        then resent to us for approval. This step usually takes about a week.<br><br>
                                        4. Review of treatment plan. At this appointment, you will get an opportunity to
                                        see the complete set up and computer simulation of your proposed treatment. The
                                        number of aligners required for the full treatment will also be included. If you
                                        are satisfied by the computer simulation, you consent and approve the treatment
                                        plan along with the dentist.<br><br>
                                        5. After approval, the custom aligners are then fabricated. We then receive the
                                        full set of aligners in a couple of weeks.<br><br>
                                        6. Insertion and issuance of aligners. The 1st set of aligners is inserted and
                                        issued to you and the treatment begins. We will make sure that they fit snugly.
                                        All instructions are given to you<br><br>
                                        7. You wear your aligners each day, removing them only while brushing and eating
                                        food. They have to be worn for 22+ hours each day. Usually the aligners are worn
                                        for 2 weeks subsequently followed by the next set.<br><br>
                                        8. A follow-up appointment with the dentist is done every 4 weeks to ensure the
                                        fit and progress of treatment. It is compared to the computerised treatment plan

                                    To keep your Invisalign aligners in good condition: <span

                                        • Take your aligners out before you eat. Always rinse them with cold or lukewarm
                                        water after removal.<br>
                                        • Do not clean them with hot water because heat can damage and warp the plastic.
                                        You can use a mild detergent.<br>
                                        • Rinse your aligners before you store them in their case. Let them dry.<br>
                                        • Do not leave them lying around outside their case especially if you have pets
                                        at home. Pets will often chew up the aligners and damage them.<br>
                                        • Continue brushing and flossing your teeth as you always do.<br>

                                    After your treatment period is over, you can maintain your new smile with a clear

                                        Retention is the most important part of your clear aligner treatment. The
                                        long-term success is dependent on wearing your retainers religiously for atleast
                                        22+ hours for more than 12 months initially. Additional wear may be advised on
                                        an individual basis.
