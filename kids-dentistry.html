                            Did you know that 1 in 5 kids between the ages of 5 and 11 has untreated dental decay? Many
                            children suffer from cavities, but with routine dental care, your child does not have to.
                            The experienced and gentle dental experts at Amelia Street Dental Clinic are here to provide

                            Baby teeth or deciduous teeth are very important for proper alignment of the adult teeth as
                            well as the proper growth of the jaws. Each and every tooth plays an important role till it
                            is shed so it is vitally important that they are looked after well and do not decay or
                            fracture.

                                        office are a good habit. In fact, after your
                                        child’s first tooth appears, you should wait no longer than 6 months before
                                        visiting the dentist. The Australian Dental Association recommends to have your
                                        child’s first dental appointment at about 12 months of age.
                                        Early dental visits make the child familiar with the dental environment, makes
                                        them more confident and gets them accustomed to preventive dental care. Good
                                        oral hygiene habits are developed early. <br><br>
                                        After that, a routine exam and cleaning should take place every six months or
                                        so. If it has been more than six months since your child has been to the
                                        dentist, now is the time to book an appointment.

                                    Does your child still engage in thumb sucking past the age of four? If it continues
                                    longer, your child may develop an open bite<span id="serv-dot-08">...</span>
                                    <span id="serv-more-08" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        or other dental problems. <br><br>
                                        We can put a fixed dental appliance on the roof of your child’s mouth to help
                                        break the habit of thumb-sucking. <br><br>
                                        The appliance is not painful, but it makes it impossible to enjoy thumb
                                        sucking.<br><br>
                                        The process usually requires around a month or more. Eventually, your child will
                                        discover another method to self-soothe.

                                    Sometimes, your child might have a tooth that is too decayed for a filling. If it is
                                    a baby tooth, it might need to come out anyway. <span id="serv-dot-09">...</span>

                                    <span id="serv-more-09" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        Baby teeth also sometimes are in the way as permanent teeth grow in near them,
                                        which can lead to misalignment.<br><br>
                                        Pulling a tooth can provide space for permanent teeth to grow in
                                        straight.<br><br>
                                        If a tooth is badly decayed, removing it can also keep decay and infection from
                                        spreading, and stop the pain your child may be in.<br><br>
                                        We know that getting a tooth pulled can be scary for a child, which is why our
                                        pediatric specialists are gentle, communicative, and compassionate. <br><br>
                                        We will make sure the area is fully numb before pulling your child’s tooth, and
                                        will ensure that they feel safe and comfortable throughout the visit.

                                        • Brushing teeth and gums twice daily for two minutes.<br>
                                        • Rinsing with mouthwash (for ages 6 and up).<br><br>
                                        You can also help out by monitoring your child’s oral care habits when they are
                                        young.<br><br><br>
                                        Some rules of the thumb for your child’s dental visit. These are recommended by
                                        the Australian Dental Association.<br><br>
                                        1. Please do not tell your child to be brave (they already are.)<br>
                                        2. Please do not bribe your child.<br>
                                        3. Please do not till your child that it won’t hurt (or it will).<br>
                                        4. Please do not use the dentist appointment as a deterrent or a punishment.<br>
                                        5. Please do not be too anxious as a parent. Your calmness encourages your
                                        child.<br>
                                        6. Listen to the dentist’s advice. Do not interfere when they are speaking. All
                                        dentists are trained well to manage children.
