                            Ouch. Suffering a tooth infection is painful. Losing that tooth forever because of that
                            infection can be even worse. But with a root canal from Amelia Street Dental Clinic, it may
                            be possible to cure your infection, end your pain, save your tooth and keep it functional.

                                <h4>What is a Root Canal treatment?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Sometimes, dental decay spreads deep in to the inner structures of the tooth and
                                    infects the pulp and the nerve. <span id="serv-dot-01">...</span>
                                    <span id="serv-more-01" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        This results in extreme pain. If you do not treat the infection, teeth with such
                                        large cavities become weaker and painful as the infection spreads deeper. A root
                                        canal treatment is a procedure that can stop this from happening. <br><br>
                                        The caries is first removed and access in to the infected pulp chamber is
                                        gained. The infected nerves and necrosed tissue are then gently removed and a
                                        thorough cleaning and shaping the nerve canal space with dedicated root canal
                                        instruments and a potent disinfecting solution is performed. This requires a
                                        number of appointments (3-4) and after adequate disinfection is achieved and the
                                        tooth is asymptomatic (pain free), a biocompatible material like gutta percha is
                                        used to seal the cleaned root space. A final filling is then placed in to the
                                        access hole. This tooth is thus saved from imminent extraction and even though
                                        it becomes a dead tooth it remains as a functional tooth. <br><br>
                                        All the dentists at Amelia Street Dental are very experienced in root canal

                                <p>
                                    It is common for patients to worry about what a root canal procedure involves. The
                                    good news is that getting a root canal can be quick,
                                    <span id="serv-dot-04">...</span>
                                    <span id="serv-more-04" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        easy, and painless. It generally requires 4-5 appointments depending on the
                                        nature and severity of the dental infection. Appointments are spaced with a 2
                                        weeks gap in between. <br><br>
                                        Here is what you can expect when you get root canal treatment at Amelia Street
                                        Dental Clinic. <br><br>
                                        1. Schedule your consultation. During your consult, we will assess to make sure
                                        that a root canal is the most suitable treatment option before proceeding. If
                                        another treatment is more appropriate, we will discuss your options.<br><br>
                                        2. Come in for your root canal appointment. We will apply local anesthetic and
                                        numb up the tooth adequately. We will ask you questions to make sure that the
                                        area is fully numb before we get to work. This is how we prevent any unnecessary
                                        discomfort during your root canal.<br><br>
                                        3. Next, we place the rubber dam (rubber sheet) over the concerned tooth an
                                        isolate it. Rubber dams are mandatory and use for protection and good infection
                                        control.<br><br>
                                        4. We then drill into your tooth from the top and create an access hole to the
                                        infected nerve.<br><br>
                                        5. We remove the infected matter from inside the tooth using dedicated root
                                        canal instruments called as files in a sequential manner to shape the root canal
                                        space and remove all of the dead, necrosed and infected tissue.<br><br>
                                        6. Special disinfecting solutions are used to facilitate thorough cleaning of
                                        the root canal system.<br><br>
                                        7. Once the inside of your tooth is completely clean, we fill the root canal
                                        space with a biocompatible material called as gutta percha which is rubber based
                                        material and seal it thoroughly to prevent any reinfection.<br><br>
                                        8. We then place a filling in the access cavity hole and top your tooth with a
                                        crown to give it adequate protection and strength.<br><br>
                                        You now have an infection-free tooth, newly strengthened with a dental filling
                                        and a beautiful crown.

                                    You should recover quickly after each root canal appointment. It takes 2-3 hours for

                                        • Taking an over-the-counter medication like Nurofen or Panadol to reduce

                                        • Occasionally, antibiotics may be prescribed in case of a large dental abscess

                                        • Crowns are mandatory for root canal treated posterior to keep them strong and
