                        <h4>Fill Cavities and Stop Tooth Decay</h4>
                        <p>
                            Does your tooth hurt or sensitive when you eat a lolly, donut or drink something cold? You
                            might have a cavity. While a cavity may not seem like a big deal, they do not go away on
                            their own. In fact, they get worse as the decay process is irreversible unless treated, and
                            eventually can cost you your tooth. <br><br>
                            Filling a cavity or getting it restored as soon as possible is the key to stopping decay,
                            saving your tooth, and ending pain. The dentists in Amelia Street Dental Clinic makes
                            fillings fast, easy, and painless so you can get in and out of the dental chair and back to
                            your life.

                                <h4>What are Dental Fillings?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    A dental filling is a restorative treatment for a tooth cavity or imperfection
                                    resulting from decay (caries), <span id="serv-dot-01">...</span>
                                    <span id="serv-more-01" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        abrasion lesions or tooth fracture due to trauma. They can be done in two ways.
                                        Direct method or indirect method. The direct method of
                                        filling is done by the dentist in the chair and usually is completed in one
                                        appointment. The indirect method requires 2 appointments in which the dentist
                                        removes the decay and prepares the cavity and takes a mould or scans the
                                        prepared. The dental laboratory then fabricates the indirect restoration, which
                                        is then cemented by the dentist at the 2nd appointment. Composites, amalgams,
                                        glass ionomers are direct filling materials while ceramics, gold are indirect
                                        filling materials.<br><br>
                                        When you have a cavity or a tooth chip, there is a hole in your tooth or part of
                                        the tooth has broken. Your dental expert removes the decayed portion of the
                                        tooth carefully keeping back sound and healthy tooth structure. Complete caries
                                        removal is ensured by using a caries dye. This gap is then treated with special
                                        agents before it is filled with a biocompatible material like composite,
                                        amalgam, or glass ionomer. All these materials have a good track record and are
                                        durable.<br><br>
                                        Nowadays, amalgam fillings are not done routinely as they are dark in colour and
                                        there have been some concerns about mercury toxicity. These are not
                                        substantiated yet and the Australian Dental Association still supports its use.
                                        They are strong and long lasting.<br><br>
                                        Composite resins (commonly called as white fillings) are the preferred choice of
                                        material for all ages. These materials are tooth coloured and are available in a
                                        number of shades. They can be used for front and back teeth are a good option
                                        for most clinical scenarios except when most of the tooth is decayed and the
                                        prepared cavity is quite large with lees of natural tooth structure remaining.
                                        With the advancement in resin materials these fillings are now done routinely in
                                        most dental practices for their aesthetic qualities. Cosmetic dentistry
                                        progressed as a science mainly due to the continuous research refinement in the
                                        composite resin technology.<br><br>
                                        Glass Ionomer Filling materials: This is an alternative which has fluoride as
                                        one of its agents. The anticariogenic property of fluoride makes it a preferred
                                        material in children, or people with high caries or decay index, or are used as
                                        temporary filling materials. They are also tooth coloured but their aesthetics
                                        are inferior as compared to composites.<br><br>
                                        Indirect restorations. When more than 60% of the original structure is damaged
                                        due to caries or fracture then indirect restorations like inlays, onlays or
                                        crowns are suggested. They offer better strength than the traditional direct
                                        fillings.

                                    can offer you a fast, easy, painless experience. <span

                                        1. We apply a local anesthetic, then wait for your tooth to be numb. Only after
                                        the anaesthetic has been able to take full effect will we proceed.<br>
                                        2. We drill into your tooth to remove the decay. You should not feel pain during
                                        this process.<br>
                                        3. We ensure complete caries removal by using a caries detector.<br>
                                        4. We then treat the cavity surface with different agents and then fill the
                                        cavity with the restorative material of choice.<br>
                                        5. You can expect mild sensitivity for a few days which settles over a period of
                                        time.<br>

                                    Following your appointment, you should wait for the anaesthetic to wear off before

                                <h3>Protect Your Teeth from Decay With Dental Fillings</h3>
                                <p>
                                    A cavity may feel like a small problem, especially if yours isn’t yet causing you
                                    pain.<br><br>
                                    But a cavity you do not treat will progress, with the decay eventually claiming your
                                    tooth.<br><br>
                                    Do not wait until you need an invasive or expensive treatment such as a root canal
                                    or a bridge to replace a lost tooth.<br><br>
                                    Schedule a filling with Amelia Street Dental Clinic so we can stop tooth decay and
                                    you can enjoy a healthy, strong tooth for the rest of your life.
