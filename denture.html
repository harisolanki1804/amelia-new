                        <p>
                            Did you lose your smile? Are your missing teeth making you morose due to sunken face? Unable
                            to enjoy the foods you love? <br><br>
                            Gum disease, tooth decay, or even an injury can cost you multiple teeth. Even when your
                            mouth is closed, you can see the difference in your sunken cheeks and a lost jawline.
                            Chewing your food can be difficult, which can affect your digestion. It can even be hard to
                            speak. Thankfully, there is a simple, cost-effective solution: dentures from Amelia Street
                            Dental Clinic.

                                    Dentures are a set of prosthetic teeth. Most dentures are removable,<span
                                        id="serv-dot-01">...</span>
                                    <span id="serv-more-01" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        though there are some types that are fixed. Dentures can also be implant
                                        supported. They can be semi-permanent with magnetic attachments. <br><br>
                                        Did you know that denture technology has advanced considerably over the years?
                                        These aren’t your grandma’s dentures. Nowadays, Dentures are made using digital
                                        methods. Use of old photographs of your face and 3-recreation of your jaws and
                                        face help make fully customized dentures which look like your original teeth.
                                        You can visualise your dentures before they are made. Better materials and
                                        aesthetic teeth make them look natural. <br><br>
                                        Not only that, but you will be amazed by just how easy it is to take care of
                                        them.

                                        Only missing a couple of teeth? You might want to consider a partial denture, a
                                        fixed bridge or implant supported fixed bridge. We can help you figure out which
                                        tooth replacement option is most suitable during your consultation and depending
                                        on your circumstances and budget. <br><br>
                                        Dentures are a good long-lasting solution which can serve you for few years.
                                        After a while, you might need to get them re-lined so that they better fit the
                                        changing shape of your alveolar ridge (bony support of the denture). <br><br>
                                        We can take care of this for you or replace them if necessary (typically
                                        dentures last 7-10 years before they need replacement). <br><br>
                                        Dentures are the most budget friendly option of replacing missing teeth.

                                        full, implant-supported dentures or immediate dentures. <br><br>
                                        • Partial: Did you know you can get dentures to replace just the teeth you are
                                        missing? Partial dentures are similar to full dentures, but they are sized to
                                        fill just the gaps in your mouth. You can remove them when you are not using
                                        them. There are of 3 types. Cast partial dentures (Metal supported dentures),
                                        Acrylic Dentures, Valplast Dentures. The cast partial dentures are the best
                                        option as they are long lasting, fit well and are firm. Your speech is also not
                                        hampered. <br><br>
                                        • Full: If you are missing all your teeth, a full set of dentures may be in
                                        order. As with partial dentures, you can take out full dentures when you do not
                                        need them. Overdentures are a type of full dentures where some teeth roots are
                                        saved intentionally to give better support and retention to your dentures. These
                                        saved root stumps minimise bone loss and resorption and help your denture to
                                        serve you for many years.<br><br>
                                        • Implant-supported dentures: These are similar to overdentures. These types of
                                        dentures rest on top of permanent implants which act as support and give
                                        stability to the denture. The chewing efficiency with these dentures is better
                                        than normal full dentures. They are like “fixed dentures” and can be removed
                                        when not needed (eg. at night). These are easy to maintain and keep clean.
                                        <br><br>
                                        • Immediate Dentures: Immediate dentures are dentures which are issued /
                                        inserted in the mouth at the same appointment when all your teeth are extracted.
                                        This is done when extraction of all teeth with poor prognosis is planned. All
                                        the steps of the denture fabrication are done prior to extraction. The best
                                        benefit is that you will never be without teeth and your smile is restored
                                        immediately.

                                    There are a minimum of five steps involved in making dentures, <span

                                        1. Schedule a consultation with your dentist to discuss your options for
                                        dentures. During this visit, you will get an OPG Xray done to rule out any jaw
                                        pathology. We then make impressions (moulds) and casts for your dentures. This
                                        is called a primary impression.<br><br>

                                        2. This is then followed by a secondary impression (final impression) of your
                                        jaws after a week to ensure the extensions and borders recorded are exact. The
                                        fit of the dentures relies on this - hence this is a crucial step in a denture
                                        making process. <br><br>

                                        3. Your third visit: This is when we check how your jaws meet to ensure that the
                                        denture teeth will properly align. This step is called as jaw relation and
                                        records the relation of the movable mandibular jaw to the fixed maxillary jaw
                                        and the soft tissue relation (Lips and cheeks) with the respective jaws in all 3
                                        dimensions This relation enables us and the dental technician to recreate a 3-D
                                        simulation of your mouth to facilitate the positioning of the artificial teeth.
                                        <br><br>

                                        4. During your fourth visit, you get to try on your dentures. Your artificial
                                        teeth will be set-up in wax and a trial will be done. This is our opportunity to
                                        make sure that everything is looking natural the arranged teeth give you the
                                        experience of your bite. The bite and jaw registration are evaluated. You can
                                        get a feel of your new denture and see if it is meeting your expectations. If
                                        any further adjustments are needed, they can easily be done. A retrial can be
                                        done if any adjustments are needed. We make sure that your dentures are looking
                                        exceptional and all the parameters and expectations are met. This is final step
                                        before finalisation of your denture. <br><br>

                                        5. Time to smile! During your final visit, you receive your new set of teeth.
                                        The fit, stability, retention and appearance are checked at this step. All the
                                        extensions of dentures are adjusted to your jaws. As they are deemed
                                        satisfactory, the dentures are issued to you with set of instructions. <br><br>

                                        6. Traditionally in a set of full dentures, the upper denture fits more firmly
                                        than a lower one because the Upper denture has more surface area and better
                                        retention can be achieved. The Lower denture being horse-shoe shaped is
                                        comparatively loose due to its close relation with the movable tongue. It takes
                                        about 4-5 weeks to get adjusted to this, but it is easier than you think. The
                                        partial dentures and implant supported dentures have more retention and
                                        stability than full dentures.
                                        <br><br>

                                        7. After the dentures are issued you may get some sore spots /ulcers in the
                                        first few days. After trimming and adjusting the dentures you will start
                                        enjoying wearing your dentures and feeling confident with your new smile.

                                        • Brush your dentures with a nonabrasive denture cleaning brush once a day to
                                        get rid of plaque, food debris or any deposits. <br>
                                        • Overnight, put your dentures in a dedicate storage box. <br>
                                        • Give your dentures a quick rinse before you reinsert them. <br>
                                        • A denture cleaning tablet (Eg.-Polident ) available in the supermarket is used
                                        for cleaning the denture. Follow the instructions mentioned on the Polident
                                        Denture Care pack.
