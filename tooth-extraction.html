                        <h4>Fast and Painless Tooth Extraction</h4>
                        <p>
                            Whenever possible, we find a way to save damaged teeth. But sometimes, decay has simply gone
                            too far, or the tooth has advanced gum disease or is mobile or is fractured right to the gum
                            level or there is no room in your mouth for a particular tooth which makes tooth extraction
                            the only treatment option available.<br><br>
                            Leaving the tooth in your mouth will cause additional problems. Infections can spread,
                            causing healthy teeth to decay. Teeth that crowd together may move further out of place,
                            compromising your bite.<br><br>
                            At times like these, you need your tooth removed to preserve the greater health of your
                            mouth.<br><br>
                            Amelia Street Dental Clinic’s gentle dental experts can quickly and painlessly remove the
                            affected tooth, putting an end to infection and pain.

                                        • Decay is too severe for a tooth to recover.<br>
                                        • We cannot do a filling, root canal, or any other treatment to save the

                                        • Your tooth is impacted or impinging on those around it (common with wisdom
                                        teeth).<br>
                                        • Your tooth is mobile and beyond repair or has advanced gum disease.<br>
                                        • For orthodontic reasons<br><br>
                                        We will always suggest other treatment modalities if we think they are
                                        appropriate
                                        to save your tooth instead of removing it. During your consultation, we can
                                        assess whether tooth extraction is necessary.<br><br>

                                    We know that you may be nervous about having a tooth removed. Dental practice has
                                    advanced and the local anaesthetics <span id="serv-dot-04">...</span>
                                    <span id="serv-more-04" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        used nowadays are very potent and reliable. This
                                        process is much easier than it was in the past. <br><br>
                                        At the beginning of your procedure, we will apply a topical local anaesthetic
                                        gel to numb up the superficial tissue. Then we will give you a painless local
                                        anaesthetic needle. In some cases, 3- 4 carpules of the anaesthetic may be
                                        needed to numb up the tooth completely. We will listen to your feedback to make
                                        sure that it has had time to take full effect before we begin the extraction
                                        process.<br><br>
                                        The extraction procedure is a definite treatment and happens when a tooth is
                                        pulled out completely from its holding structure in the jawbone (The socket).
                                        The periodontal ligament which encases the tooth root is separated and the tooth
                                        is delivered out of the socket. The dentist will use different types of
                                        instruments like extraction forceps, elevators, luxators etc to extract the
                                        tooth.<br><br>
                                        The ease or difficulty with an extraction is dependent on many factors, like the
                                        extent of decay, number of roots, position of the tooth, age of the patient etc.
                                        All extractions are planned by assessing the existing condition of the tooth,
                                        the xray, the medical history, medications etc to make the experience as easy as
                                        possible.<br><br>
                                        In some cases, teeth may be required to be extracted surgically to make it less
                                        traumatic.<br><br>
                                        After extractions, a folded gauze is placed on the extraction site to arrest
                                        bleeding by way of pressure.<br><br>
                                        In some cases, you can be in and out of the dentist’s chair in as little as 20
                                        minutes.<br><br>
                                        You will be given verbal as well as written post extraction instructions. Please
                                        follow the. You can find the instructions here (Click here)

                                    Patients may hesitate to schedule a tooth extraction because they are concerned it
                                    will be painful.<br><br>
                                    But the gentle dental experts at Amelia Street Dental Clinic can minimize discomfort

                                    other teeth.<br><br>
