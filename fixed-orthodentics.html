                            Crooked teeth? Unsightly gaps? Problems with your bite? Any of these can erode your
                            confidence and make you hesitant to smile. Worse, they can make it hard to chew, and in some
                            cases, may even contribute to issues with bruxism (teeth grinding), tooth wear, and jaw
                            pain. <br><br>
                            With fixed orthodontics, Amelia Street Dental Clinic can correct the issues with your bite,
                            perfecting your smile and protecting your oral health.

                                    Fixed orthodontics are better known simply as braces. They are appliances <span

                                        which are fixed on the surfaces of your teeth, and you wear them for a period of
                                        18 to 24 months. Gentle pressure is applied through a system of metal wires.
                                        This pressure gradually moves your teeth into alignment.<br><br>
                                        Once your teeth are aligned, the braces are removed, and you get to delight in
                                        your new smile.

                                <p>
                                    1. We start out with a full oral exam, a set of X-rays and a set of Intra-oral <span
                                        id="serv-dot-04">...</span>
                                    <span id="serv-more-04" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        and Extra-oral photos during your consultation. <br>
                                        2. Next, we create a plaster dental cast called as study model.<br>

                                        3. A thorough planning and analysis is done using 3-D software and then the
                                        treatment plan is formulated. It is customised for each patient. This is then
                                        discussed with patient / parents and their consent is obtained. then
                                        discussed.<br>

                                        4. During this visit, we fix your braces. This initial process can take anywhere
                                        from 1-2 hours. An initial gentle force wire is engaged into the braces.<br>

                                        5. On a periodic basis, you will need to come in for an adjustment and change of
                                        wires. This is a quicker process than the initial placement and the appointment
                                        duration is between 30-40 minutes. You may feel mild discomfort for a few hours
                                        after these appointments. An over-the-counter Nurofen can help with pain
                                        management.<br>

                                        6. In a matter of 18-24 months, you will find your teeth getting aligned and
                                        corrected.<br>

                                        7. Once your teeth are fully aligned and your perfect smile is achieved, we can
                                        remove your braces and issue your removable clear retainers. You can then enjoy
                                        the full benefits of straight teeth! This ends the active corrective phase of
                                        treatment, and the most important retention phase of your treatment starts. The
                                        retentive clear aligners must be worn for almost 24 hours for a period of 12
                                        months to 24 months. They can be removed only while brushing and eating
                                        food.<br>

                                        8. A final set of Xrays and photographs are taken marking the end of treatment.
                                        The changes and improvements that have occurred since the start are compared and
                                        evaluated.<br>

                                        How long you will wear your braces depends on your individual situation, but 1-3
                                        years is typical.

                                    Ideally, fixed braces should be initiated during the growing phase of the
                                    individual.<span id="serv-dot-05">...</span>
                                    <span id="serv-more-05" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        (Girls between 11 to 14 years and Boys between 12-15 years,) This
                                        optimizes the results as the bone supporting the teeth is soft and facilitates
                                        ease of tooth movement.<br><br>

                                        However, braces can be done for adults too. The only prerequisite is good oral
                                        hygiene with minimal decay, excellent bone and gum condition and a lot of
                                        self-motivation on part of the patient.<br><br>

                                        Types of Fixed braces<br>
                                        Contemporary orthodontic treatment can be done using<br><br>

                                        1. Metal braces: These are metallic commonly made of Chrome-Cobalt alloy.
                                        Precious metal or Gold alloy braces are also available.<br>

                                        2. Ceramic braces: These are tooth coloured. The wires used are also tooth
                                        coloured and thus offer the advantage of being less visible to the naked
                                        eye.<br>

                                        3. Lingual braces: These are metallic braces fixed on the back side of the
                                        teeth., making them almost impossible to see. They are in close approximation to
                                        the tongue and therefore take a longer time to adjust. These patients will also
                                        tend to get more ulcers and brushing, and cleaning is cumbersome and takes a
                                        longer time.<br><br>

                                        The results achieved with any method is the same and the type selected will be
                                        based on individual’s needs.<br><br>

                                        Speech can be hampered initially with braces resulting in a lisp. It takes a
                                        couple of weeks to get adjusted to this and is not a long-lasting effect. After
                                        a small adjustment period, this is self-corrected.

                                <p>
                                    You will need to make some minor changes to your routines while wearing braces.<span
                                        id="serv-dot-06">...</span>

                                    <span id="serv-more-06" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        Here is how to maintain them: <br><br>

                                        • Continue to brush and floss. In fact, you will want to spend a little extra
                                        time on each tooth. You can use a floss threader to get around your braces. <br>

                                        • Rinsing out your mouth can help you get rid of debris. <br>

                                        • Certain foods do not go well with braces. Examples include popcorn, nuts,
                                        caramel, and gum or any hard or crunchy food. Try not to eat them. <br><br>

                                        Remember, adequate and satisfactory oral hygiene is paramount for success with
                                        braces.<br><br>

                                        In general, you will find your life is largely unchanged with braces. Before
                                        long, you will not even think about your new routine.
