                        <h4>Get the Perfect Fit With a Custom Mouth Guard </h4>
                        <p>
                            Are you playing contact sports? Are you playing it safe? Each year thousands of Australian
                            children and adults get treated for traumatic sports related dental injuries. All of these
                            can easily be minimised or prevented by wearing a good fitting mouthguard.<br><br>
                            The Australian Dental Association and Sports Medicine Australia have a “mouthguard policy”
                            and recommend a mouthguard to be worn by all sportsperson during training and games. All
                            clubs have been mandated to operate a strict “No Mouthguard, No Play” policy. <br><br>
                            Whichever contact sport you are enjoying, make sure you have the right fitting mouth guard.
                            You know how hard it can be to find the perfect fit in stock mouthguard available at
                            pharmacies or the super-shopee. The wrong mouth guard can make things worse and are more
                            harmful than protective. They tend to slip off and are loose and do not protect your teeth
                            and haw bones from atraumatic injury. That is why you need a custom mouth guard from Amelia
                            Street Dental Clinic.

                                <p>
                                    A mouth guard is a removable dental device made of a high strength specialised
                                    material <span id="serv-dot-01">...</span>
                                    <span id="serv-more-01" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        that you place over your teeth and gums. It covers all the teeth and its
                                        purpose is to keep your teeth, gums and jaw bones protected in an event of a
                                        traumatic sport injury or a fall. <br><br>
                                        Mouth guards are available over-the-counter, but the chances of finding the
                                        right fit are slim —especially if you have uneven teeth.<br><br>
                                        A mouth guard that does not fit correctly is very difficult to keep in the mouth
                                        and often falls out thus offering no protection. A poorly fitting mouthguard can
                                        be detrimental to your jaw joint resulting in pain soreness of the muscles of
                                        mastication.<br><br>
                                        A custom mouth guard is the solution. We fabricate a mouth guard that is
                                        designed to perfectly fit your mouth and protect your teeth and thereby offer
                                        optimum protection to your teeth, gums, and jaw bones.

                                        • Common Australian sports like AFL, rugby, boxing, hockey often have
                                        intentional collisions which is part of the game. Other sports like martial
                                        arts, skating etc are also quite risky. It’s a “No brainer” to use custom
                                        mouthguards for such sporting activities. <br>

                                        A custom mouth guard will offer you superior performance over
                                        an over-the-counter mouth guard. <br><br>
                                        • Because a custom mouth guard is moulded and fabricated to fit your mouth, it
                                        is more comfortable to wear than an OTC mouth guard. <br><br>
                                        • Our modern mouth guards are made of dual layer of flexible, soft but strong
                                        material. This inside surface is soft and gives a cushioning effect to the teeth
                                        and the outside surface is hard and rigid giving it the strength. They are about
                                        4mm in thickness making them less obtrusive to wear than old-fashioned mouth
                                        guards.<br><br>
                                        • Dental sports injuries can result in time off school or work. They are painful
                                        and disfiguring and often involves costly, lengthy, and complex treatment. The
                                        cost of the mouthguard is negligible as compared to the cost of treating a
                                        dental injury.

                                        1. Come in for your consultation. During your visit, we discuss your reasons for
                                        ordering a custom mouth guard so we can make sure that this is the right plan
                                        for achieving your goals. We also take an impression of your mouth. <br>
                                        2. We use these impressions to make a plaster cast. <br>
                                        3. Next, we design your custom mouth guard using these plaster casts. Factors
                                        like age, number of teeth erupted, position and alignment of teeth, teeth which
                                        are most likely to be injured in an accidental injury are considered before
                                        designing a mouthguard. The same is conveyed to the dental technician for
                                        perfect fabrication. <br>
                                        4. The custom mouthguard is then fabricated as per our specification. <br>
                                        5. Come in for your next visit after 4-5 days. This is when we check the fit of
                                        your mouth guard. As it fabricated in the dental laboratory using your models,
                                        most adjustments are already done. But if any further adjustments are needed, we
                                        do them now.<br><br>
                                        That is it! Wear your custom mouth guard for the protection during sports and
                                        have a restful night of sleep after athletic events.

                                    In growing child aged 6 and above, custom mouthguards need to be changed every 12
                                    months at least <span id="serv-dot-07">...</span>

                                        as the old mouthguard will not fit precisely due to the loss of baby
                                        teeth, eruption of adult teeth and change in the jaw structure, braces. <br><br>
                                        Adults may have to change their mouthguard if there is any change in their
                                        existing dentition. (ie, loss of tooth, new crowns etc.)<br><br>
                                        The rule of the thumb is “If it does not fit snugly, change it.”
