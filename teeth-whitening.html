                        <p>
                            Would you like to brighten your smile for a big event? Are you looking to improve the colour
                            of your teeth and have a great charming smile? Or Are you feeling that your teeth are
                            discoloring or yellowing due to age? <br><br>
                            No matter why you're looking for a brighter, whiter smile, Amelia Street Dental is here to
                            help you achieve and maintain your dream smile. <br><br>
                            Our teeth are one of the first things people notice about us, and whether we like it or not,
                            they form an opinion about our smile. Quite often our confidence and nature is judged on our
                            smile. <br><br>
                            A healthy smile is associated with white teeth. Bright, attractive smiles convey confidence
                            and vitality. The appearance of discolored or stained teeth can lower your confidence,
                            especially when it comes to your smile. You may be self-conscious when smiling, laughing,
                            and speaking with stained, yellow, or dull teeth. <br><br>
                            Unfortunately, many people are affected by discolored or stained teeth. Whether it's due to
                            coffee, tea, cigarettes, or your family's genetics, or age-related changes, teeth can become
                            yellow and stained. At the same time, some medications can also cause teeth discoloration.
                            <br><br>
                            At Amelia Street Dental, we focus on restoring the natural beauty of your smile with our
                            professional teeth whitening treatments.

                                    Teeth whitening is an inexpensive way to enhance the appearance of your teeth. <span

                                        Teeth whitening, also known as tooth bleaching, is a cosmetic procedure that
                                        improves the appearance and color of your teeth. Teeth whitening is an excellent
                                        approach to brighten your smile and boost your self-esteem without harming your
                                        teeth.<br><br>
                                        A dental examination is vital before starting any whitening treatment. This
                                        ensures the procedure will be effective for you and take into account your
                                        specific tooth sensitivity level. <br><br>
                                        You may enjoy all the benefits of a clean, beautiful, pearly white smile in just
                                        a few hours: <br><br>

                                        and unsafe. These "one size fits all" teeth whitening kits can sometimes be too
                                        small or large for your mouth because they are not custom-made for your teeth.
                                        The whitening gels that come with this type of kit can be overly abrasive or
                                        leak due to ill-fitting trays, causing discomfort to the gums and other soft
                                        tissues. These gels are not optimized for your teeth. <br><br>
                                        For these reasons, you may want to choose professional teeth whitening instead.
                                        Professional whitening treatments can remove years of discoloration and deeper
                                        stains than over-the-counter kits.<br><br>
                                        A professional-quality teeth whitening treatment is one of the fastest, safest,
                                        and most affordable ways to achieve a whiter smile. <br><br>
                                        The advantages of professionally whitened teeth are: <br><br>
                                        1. Superior results<br>
                                        2. Custom-made trays for optimum comfort and effectiveness<br>

                                        These teeth get discolored due to leaching of blood pigments after the trauma
                                        and discoloration varies from yellow, brown to black. These teeth must be root
                                        canal treated prior to this procedure. <br><br>
                                        It is specialized procedure done at the dental office and requires multiple
                                        appointments. A powerful bleaching agent or an oxidizing agent is used for the
                                        procedure and is placed in the internal chamber of the tooth (crown portion)
                                        above the obturated root canal space. The agent is kept in the space for a
                                        number of days and the access hole is sealed with a temporary cement. The
                                        procedure is repeated until the preferred result is achieved. Finally, a
                                        tooth-colored filling will be done to cover up the access hole. A ceramic crown
                                        may also be recommended.<br><br>
                                        The whitening effect is permanent unlike the other 2 whitening procedures. The
                                        amount of whitening achieved is dependent on the amount of original
                                        discoloration of the traumatized tooth.<br><br>
                                        Excellent results are achieved with this procedure and is recommended for all
                                        traumatized discolored anterior teeth.
