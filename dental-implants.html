                        <h4>The best way to replace missing teeth</h4>
                        <p>
                            Missing teeth are a painful, embarrassing, and traumatic condition. They can affect your
                            self-esteem, job prospects, daily living and lead to a decline in quality of life. <br><br>
                            You may experience difficulty in chewing, pain while eating or drinking, and possibly even
                            speech problems.<br><br>
                            Missing teeth can lead to a derangement of your bite, which causes food to get trapped
                            between your teeth and excessive load on the existing teeth. This leads to tooth decay and
                            gum disease, which can eventually result in losing more teeth.<br><br>
                            The good news is that there is a solution.<br><br>
                            Dental Implants are the only permanent solution that can replace a missing tooth or several
                            teeth at once. They provide you with the same look and function as your natural teeth and
                            allow you to eat, speak, and brush like normal so that you will be confident enough to show
                            off your new smile!

                                <h4>What are Dental Implants?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    A dental implant is a synthetic tooth root surgically placed in the bone to restore
                                    a missing tooth.<span id="serv-dot-01">...</span>
                                    <span id="serv-more-01" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        The implant is made up of 3 parts: the post, abutment, and
                                        porcelain crown. A titanium post or a screw is surgically placed in the bone
                                        below the gums to create a foundation for attaching a dental crown or prosthetic
                                        tooth. Once the implant has been firmly secured to the jaw, an abutment is
                                        fitted securely in place to complete this part of the treatment. <br><br>

                                        The titanium post becomes incorporated into your jawbone by a natural process
                                        called as osseintegration. This is one of the most significant advantages of
                                        dental implants and makes the implant firm and securely attached to the bone.
                                        <br><br>

                                        The crown part is typically done after 3 months of implant placement in the
                                        bone. This allows for achieving adequate stability. <br><br>

                                        Patients with implants need to be proactive in their maintenance protocol and
                                        will need regular checkups to ensure that the implant is functioning properly
                                        and that any complications, such as infections, loose crowns, etc are treated
                                        promptly.<br><br>

                                        The entire procedure, on average, takes three to six months. The majority of
                                        patients are not affected in their normal routine. The implant placement which
                                        is a surgical appointment will need about an hour or so and we at Amelia Street
                                        Dental pride ourselves in the absolute aseptic protocol followed. All our
                                        dentists and staff are highly trained for this treatment modality. <br><br>

                                        Simply put, dental implants can provide you with the healthy, natural-looking
                                        tooth that you deserve.

                                <p>
                                    Dental implants are the best conservative treatment option for replacing missing
                                    <span id="serv-dot-02">...</span>

                                        teeth by fixed natural-looking and functioning artificial teeth. <br><br>
                                        In the past, patients only had the choice was to wear removable dentures or have
                                        fixed bridges placed alongside two adjacent teeth. This is still an advantageous
                                        and practical option, but implants do not require removable appliances or filing
                                        down adjacent teeth. <br><br>
                                        For some, the decision between dentures, bridges and dental implants are a
                                        difficult one. While dentures and bridges are both viable options for replacing
                                        missing teeth, with their own set of advantages, dental implants are often more
                                        popular due to the following reasons: <br><br>
                                        - Dental implants offer a permanent solution to tooth loss <br>
                                        - Unlike dentures, there won't be any slipping, clicking, or goopy pastes. <br>
                                        - Restoring chewing function and strength. <br>
                                        - Unlike bridges that need to be replaced every 10-15 years, dental implants
                                        last for a lifetime. <br>
                                        - Due to their design, dental implants have a greater functionality than
                                        bridges. They feel more like a natural tooth.
