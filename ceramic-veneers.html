                                    Veneers are quickest way to a beautiful and perfect smile. This treatment modality
                                    is perfect for those who have teeth <span id="serv-dot-01">...</span>
                                    <span id="serv-more-01" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        which are stained, chipped, have gaps or are crooked or overlapping. This being
                                        an irreversible procedure, it is important to know all the information, choices
                                        and potential risks associated. Discuss with our dentist if this is the right
                                        procedure for you and the benefits associated with it. <br><br>
                                        Veneers can be described as thin shells or facings made up of ceramic or
                                        composite resin material which are bonded to your teeth. Our dental experts
                                        create a custom set for you in a lab and are contoured and shaped in such a way
                                        that a natural homogenous smile is created. They cover the fronts of the teeth
                                        and look just like real enamel.<br><br>
                                        Veneers are a more conservative option than crowns<br><br>
                                        Veneers can be made of ceramic or a composite material. Ceramic veneers are also
                                        called “porcelain veneers.”<br><br>
                                        We recommend ceramic over composite veneers because unlike composite veneers,
                                        they are not prone to discoloration.

                                    You will be amazed by how quick and easy it is to get outfitted with a set of custom

                                        1. The process starts with an in-depth consultation.<br>
                                        We want to know exactly how you feel about your smile. What do you want to
                                        change? What do you want to stay the same? Based on what you tell us, we can
                                        come up with a custom plan for your ceramic veneers.<br>
                                        2. We take a set of intra oral and extra oral photos, impressions or scans of
                                        your teeth and then use digital smile designing to create a mock-up of your
                                        proposed smile. If you are satisfied by the computer simulation, we then
                                        fabricate a set of temporary veneers for you. During this step, we also shave
                                        down your enamel to prep the tooth surfaces for the veneers. Less than a
                                        millimeter of shaving is required.<br>
                                        If there are things you want to change about the temporary veneers, let us know
                                        so we can adjust the look of your final veneers.<br>
                                        3. Once you are happy with the temporary veneers, we scan or take impressions of
                                        your prepared teeth and send it to the dental laboratory for final
                                        fabrication.<br>
                                        4. We advise our patients to see our local dental technician based in Perth for
                                        shade selection and let him know your expectations.<br>
                                        5. Come in receive your final veneers. We will make sure that the fit of the
                                        veneers is perfect, and that you are happy with the shape and colour. If any
                                        last-minute adjustments are needed to fine-tune the veneers to your liking, we
                                        will do so now.<br>
                                        6. The last step is to bond the ceramic veneers permanently to your teeth. The
                                        transformation is instant. Now your perfect smile is yours to enjoy!
