                                    Amelia St Dental accepts all health funds, (including but not limited to BUPA,
                                    Medibank, HBF, HCF, HIF, NIB, Qantas health, AHM, CBHS etc) and your rebates or
                                    entitlements can be claimed instantaneously through our HICAPS terminal. The amount
                                    that each health <span id="serv-dot-02">...</span>
                                    <span id="serv-more-02" class="hiddenDetail">
                                        fund member gets on his rebate is entirely dependent on the level
                                        of cover one has with the health fund and the preferred provider status of the
                                        practice.<br><br>
                                        Each health fund member will have a maximum limit of entitlement per year or an
                                        annual limit or rebate per year to claim. The amount is decided on the level of
                                        extras cover (or ancillary cover) one has taken up as part of their cover. The
                                        claim period usually runs from 1st Jan till 31st Dec each year, hence it is
                                        imperative to use your entitlement before the 31st of December each year. It is
                                        not carried forward to the next year therefore it is prudent for health fund
                                        members to claim it before it is forfeited.<br><br>
                                        Most of the preventive and diagnostic services like exams, x-rays, scale and
                                        clean are covered with small gap payable. Rebate for treatment services like
                                        fillings, extractions etc is determined on an individual basis and by your level
                                        of cover. It is best to clarify with your health fund on your level of cover.
                                        Typically, those who have major dental cover will get more rebate as part of
                                        their cover.<br><br>

                                            It is always preferrable to get a quote on HICAPS, so you are aware of the
                                            rebate and the gap payment.<br><br>
                                            Please note: Gap payments or out of pocket expenses will be dependent on
                                            your level of cover.
